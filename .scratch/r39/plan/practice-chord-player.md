# R39-10 · Chord player, redesigned

Premium here means a chord sheet that reads like a lead sheet and plays like Musicca's chord player: sections of bars,
each chord tapped to change it, the keys showing what sounds, nothing on screen that is not the song.

## The rulings as they stand

- "Chord player: Musicca's controls and options, with the best free sounds."
- "the Chord player simple, Apple-like, its drag and drop working (memory-palaces' fix)": sections move by their grip;
  on a laptop the key's chords drag into a bar.
- Every Practice page has its own settings (a gear): Instruments (Piano, Bass, Drums, each on or off with a level) and
  Chord names (Letters · Numerals), the homes `chordPlayer.names` and `chordPlayer.voicing` in `registry.ts`.
- A key or root is one of the pickers (the root grid). Play controls sit in a bar above the keys, covering nothing.
- A loss that can be undone happens at once with Undo (R38): Delete chord.
- No finger numbers on the keys; no explanation line under a control.
